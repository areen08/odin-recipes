        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The original Hershey's chocolate cake, which was made with six candy bars, was developed post-World War II. Americans loved the recipe because it celebrated the end of food shortages and, thus, the end of the war years.</p>
        <p>When you hear the phrase "Hershey's chocolate cake" these days, you'll likely think of Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake — the recipe found on the back of the brand's unsweetened cocoa powder box.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
            <li>Leaveners</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Eggs</li> 
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Vanilla</li>
            <li>Boiling Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the Batter: </strong>Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the wet ingredients and beat with an electric mixer for about three minutes. Stir in the boiling water by hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the Cake: </strong>Pour the batter into two prepared round cake pans. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool slightly before removing from the pans.</li>
            <li><strong>Frost the Cake: </strong>While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth and spreadable.When the cake is completely cooled, top each layer with the frosting. Stack them and continue frosting until the cake is completely covered.</li>
        </ol>
